# About
Node.js client library for Salesforce Force.com services.

This libary provices access to 2 main Force.com services:
- Authentication through OAuth 2.0
- Data through Force.com REST APIs

The authentication service of this project is largely inspired by [cangencer's project](https://github.com/cangencer/salesforce-oauth2).


## Installation
This project can be installed through NPM:
```sh
$ npm install salesforce-node-client --save
```

## Documentation
Work in progress...


## Sample application
A sample React.js application that integrates with Salesforce using this client can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/pozil/salesforce-react-integration).<br/>
Even if you are not familiar with React.js, the Node.js backend code is worth looking at.
